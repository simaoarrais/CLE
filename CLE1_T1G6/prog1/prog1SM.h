 *  Both threads and the monitor are implemented using the pthread library which enables the creation of a

 *  Data transfer region implemented as a monitor.

 *  Definition of the operations carried out by the threads:
 *     \li (worker) readFromFile

 *     \li (main) storeFileNames
 *     \li (main) printResults.
