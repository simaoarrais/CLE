 * @brief Problem name: Bitonic Integer Sorting.
 *
 *  Synchronization based on monitors.
 *  Both threads and the monitor are implemented using the pthread library which enables the creation of a
 *  monitor of the Lampson / Redell type.
 *
 *  Data transfer region implemented as a monitor.
 *
 *  Definition of the operations carried out by the threads:
 *     \li (distributor) readFromFileAndStore
 *     \li (distributor) distributeRanges
 *     \li (main) storeFileName
 *     \li (main) validateSequence
 *     \li (worker) fetchSubSequence
 *     \li (worker) signalFinished.
